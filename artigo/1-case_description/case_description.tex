This case study is meticulously designed to immerse students enrolled in Systems Analysis and Design, Systems Development, and Database courses. Beyond the immediate scope of creating a tourist route planning optimization system, the overarching goal is to enable students to visualize the broader applications of operational research. While operational research is conventionally associated with sectors like manufacturing, logistics, and finance, its principles are increasingly relevant in less traditional fields, such as tourism. By delving into this case, students will not only grasp the intricacies of developing a system tailored for tourism but also appreciate the versatility and potential of operational research methodologies. They will be encouraged to think innovatively, exploring how optimization and analytical techniques can be applied to diverse challenges across various industries.
